%   ambiguity velocity [m/s] is used to correct raw beam 
%   intensities for phase ambiguity.
%     1.0714 m/s is the AD2CP value as specified by Nortek.
%     (full wrap, ie [-pi pi]).
%   The recommended default action is to correct the velBeam
%   data for phase ambiguity.
%
%   wag radius [m] can be used to correct horizontal (Y) velocity:
%     0.43m is the geometric calculated value for AD2CP on WFP.
%   Wag signal is always calculated and included as a data product.
%   Whether it is used to correct velY is determined by the value
%   of correct_velY_for_wag. It is likely that a higher empirically
%   derived effective radius should be used. 
%      
%   correct velocities for pitch and roll:
%     a value of 0 results in no correction.
%     a value of 1 enables correction.
%   Recommended default action is to NOT correct because pitch
%   and roll values are typically small.
%
%   correct upwards velocity for profiler motion (dP/dt):
%     a value of 0 results in no correction.
%     a value of 1 enables correction.
%   It is observed that sometimes there are time and shape shifts 
%   between the velU and dP/dt signals. The dP/dt signal is 
%   calculated and included as a data product for comparison
%   regardless of the switch setting.
