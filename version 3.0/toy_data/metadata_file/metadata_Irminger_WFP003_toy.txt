% AND CAL FILES ON THE LOCAL COMPUTER

% Any of the 4 combinations of McLane unpacker settings:
%       [ (space|comma delimited) & (headers|noheaders) ]
%   can be used to unpack profiler data. If headers are enabled
%   (recommended), the beginning and ending text rows for each
%   profile are written to text fields in the array of structures
%   containing the processed data.
% 
% Rows starting with % are ignored and can be used as comments
%   to insert supplemental information concerning the deployment
%   or processing.
%
% Rows specifying metadata values needed for processing should
%   be of the form: variablename=value. spaces can be freely
%   used for readability.
% 
% Null text entry value is '' (two single quotes).
% Null numerical entry is 0 with one exception (profiles_to_process)

% PROFILER TYPE
%   OOI profilers can be either 'coastal' or 'global'

% DEPLOYMENT ID:
%   this must be a character vector enclosed by single quotes; 
%   it will be prepended to the name of the matfile saved by 
%   the processing code, which is 'MMP__yyyymmdd_HHMMSS' where
%   yyyymmdd_HHMMSS denotes the processing date and time. if 
%   no deployment ID is desired, use ''.

%   the profiles_to_process entry can either be:

%   units are db.
%
%   (a) [minimum_bin_value   bin_size   maximum_bin_value]
%   (b) bin_size
%
%    if only bin_size is given the extrema will be

%     flagged as bad data in the profile mask. to disable this
%     feature enter a large negative value (-99).
%   ctd profile mask:
%     flag a data point as bad when any profiler speed value 
%     within a centered window dips below the minimum speed 
%     setting. to disable this feature set the speed to a

% SENSOR FILTER TIME CONSTANTS

%   (3) flag as bad only pressure=0 sections.

% SENSOR DEPTH OFFSETS
%   for pressure binning non-ctd sensors;
%     global profilers have the longer body.
%   negative values denote that the sensor in question is
